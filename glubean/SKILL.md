# Glubean

Use this skill as a Glubean best-practice guide. Default to the real project workflow. Scratch mode is an extension quick demo path, not the normal agent path.

## Modes

1. **Docs**: product questions, concepts, comparison, migration, editor support, or cloud features.
2. **Onboarding**: no Glubean project yet; the user needs extension, MCP, cookbook, or project init guidance.
3. **Project**: the user is already in a Glubean project, or clearly wants to do real project test work, including migration from existing API assets.

## Route first

Before choosing a mode:

- Check for `package.json`, `config/`, `schemas/`, `contracts/`, `tests/`, `explore/`, `.env`, `.env.secrets`, and `GLUBEAN.md`.
- Check whether `@glubean/sdk` is already present in dependencies or devDependencies.
- Check whether MCP tools are available.
- If `GLUBEAN.md` exists, read it first as the project's context file.
- Users should keep key context there, including pointers to relevant code, docs, specs, and sibling workspaces.
- If the user explicitly provides additional context locations, read those too before guessing from the API alone.

Then route by intent plus environment:

- **Docs**: explanation only, with no active project task. Read [references/docs-mode.md](references/docs-mode.md).
- **Onboarding**: no Glubean project yet, and the user wants to get set up properly. Read [references/onboarding.md](references/onboarding.md).
- **Project**: the repo already looks like a Glubean project, or the user wants real test work in one. Read [references/project-mode.md](references/project-mode.md).

## Intent examples

- Docs
  - "What is Glubean?"
  - "How does Glubean compare to Postman?"
  - "How do I run tests in CI?"
  - "How do I migrate from Postman?" (answer from patterns/migration.md)
- Onboarding
  - "Set up Glubean for my project"
  - "I want to try Glubean"
  - "Configure MCP for Cursor"
- Migration (cross-cutting — execution requests, ask before routing)
  - "Migrate our Postman collection"
  - "Convert our Apifox or OpenAPI export"
  - "Port these old API tests into Glubean"
  - → Ask: "Set up a new Glubean project for this, or add to the current one?"
  - → New project → Onboarding → init → migration pattern
  - → Current project → Project → test-after → migration pattern
- Project — test-after (API already exists)
  - "Write smoke tests for /users"
  - "Improve my test coverage"
  - "Fix this failing test"
  - "Add auth boundary tests"
- Project — contract-first (API not yet implemented, or structured spec needed)
  - "I need a users API with CRUD"
  - "Design the billing endpoint before I implement it"
  - "Write contracts for my API" (uses `contract.http()` in `contracts/`)
  - "What's my contract coverage?"
  - "Generate a projection report"

## Global rules

Apply these unless project-specific instructions override them:

1. Secrets go in `.env.secrets`; public config goes in `.env`. For multi-environment setup, read [references/patterns/multi-env.md](references/patterns/multi-env.md).
2. Use `configure()` to create shared HTTP clients, then use the exported client (e.g. `api`) in tests — not `ctx.http`. `ctx.http` is only for scratch demos.
3. Use `{{KEY}}` for env and secret interpolation, bare strings for literals.
4. Put tags on every test.
5. Use builder mode when a test needs teardown or multi-step state passing.
6. Use kebab-case test IDs, unique across the project.
7. In real projects, keep reusable response types in `types/`. Inline them only for tiny throwaway examples the user explicitly asked for.
8. Do not use `.json<any>()`. If response shape is still unknown, start with `.json<unknown>()`. Use `Record<string, unknown>` only when you already know the top-level value is an object. Then narrow to a real type or Zod as soon as fields are known.
9. In real projects, keep reusable Zod schemas in `schemas/`. Inline them only for tiny throwaway examples the user explicitly asked for.
10. Use `test.each` and `test.pick` only when every case exercises the same endpoint or the same operation pattern. If endpoints are unrelated, write separate exported tests. **Test IDs must include a `$field` or `$_pick` placeholder** so each case gets a unique ID at runtime (e.g. `"search-$q"`, `"user-$_pick"`).
11. Auth configuration requires explicit user confirmation. Before writing any auth code, present your reasoning (strategy, header names, secret names, source of evidence) and wait for the user to confirm or correct. Do not silently configure auth.
12. If core project structure is missing, do not hand-create the scaffold. Prompt the user to run `npx glubean@latest init`.
13. When the user confirms a project-level decision (auth strategy, context location, naming convention, business rule), suggest adding it to `GLUBEAN.md` so future sessions pick it up.

For detailed navigation, start with [references/index.md](references/index.md).

For migration inside a real project, read [references/patterns/migration.md](references/patterns/migration.md) before generating files.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as the target endpoint, file, tag, or natural-language test request.
